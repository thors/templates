\setlength{\parskip}{1cm plus4mm minus3mm}The first paragraph after a heading is not indented. For subsequent paragraphs you can define the indent for the first line using \qindex{parindent} and the gap between paragraphs using \qindex{parskip}

The next paragraph starts with an indented line, second line is not indented. We can modify the indent e.g. to 4cm. \setlength{\parindent}{4cm} \marginpar{You can add side notes using \qindex{marginpar}}\index{Annotation}\index{Side notes}

Now the indent is a bit bigger. 

\noindent \index{Paragraph!Skip indent}But I can skip the indent as well. Lets set it back to 15pt. \setlength{\parindent}{15pt}
\index{Paragraph!Indent width}
